# Workshop: Coding with AI

## Title

**Workshop: Coding with AI — Supercharge Your Development with GitHub Copilot**

---

## Description

AI coding assistants are transforming how developers write, debug, and maintain code — and the developers who learn to use them effectively have a serious edge. This hands-on, 4-hour workshop teaches you how to put GitHub Copilot to work in your everyday development, right from the browswer — no local setup required.

We'll start with a big-picture look at the AI coding landscape — what tools are out there, how they compare, and what makes GitHub Copilot the right choice for this workshop. Then we roll up our sleeves and get to work. You'll use GitHub Copilot to generate code, debug problems, refactor solutions, handle errors gracefully, and tackle real coding tasks across the full workshop.

This is not a lecture-heavy theory class. You'll be writing code alongside the instructor, working through practical exercises, and walking away with skills you can apply the very next day. Everything runs in your browser through GitHub Codespaces, so there's nothing to install and nothing to configure — just show up and code.

By the end, you'll know how to write better prompts, avoid common pitfalls, and think critically about when to trust the AI and when to verify its output.

**Course Length:** 4 Hours  
**Includes a Certificate of Completion**

## System Requirements

This workshop is entirely browser-based — no local software installation is required. Any modern device with a browser and a stable internet connection is sufficient.

- **Browser:** A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari — latest version recommended)
- **Internet:** A stable internet connection is required throughout the session; all tools and GitHub Copilot run in the cloud
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, Linux, or ChromeOS — anything that runs a modern browser works
- **Hardware:** Any laptop or desktop purchased in the last several years is sufficient; no high-end specs required

## VM / Lab / Student Information

No virtual machines, local installs, or special lab environments are required. All tools run in the browser using **GitHub Codespaces**, which provides a full VS Code development environment in the cloud — already configured with GitHub Copilot.

**What You Need Before Class:**

- A **GitHub account** — create one for free at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one
- **GitHub Copilot access** — Copilot offers a free tier as well as a 30-day trial for new users; either will work for this workshop. Verify your access at [github.com/settings/copilot](https://github.com/settings/copilot)
- A **modern web browser** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari)
- A **stable internet connection** for the full 4 hours

**How It Works:**

All workshop exercises run inside GitHub Codespaces — a cloud-hosted development environment accessible entirely from your browser. VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and all required tools are preconfigured in the Codespace. Students click a link, the environment launches in their browser, and they're ready to code within minutes.

**Workshop Materials:**

A GitHub repository link will be provided at the start of the session. All starter code, sample files, and exercise instructions are included in the repo. Students launch their Codespace directly from the repository with a single click.

## Who Should Take This Workshop

This workshop is for developers, system administrators, IT professionals, and security practitioners who write code and want to work faster and smarter — but it's equally for people who have never written code and want to start. AI tools like GitHub Copilot have fundamentally lowered the barrier to entry for software development, and this class is designed to meet students wherever they are.

If you've always wanted to automate a task, build a tool, or understand how software works but felt intimidated by coding, this is your entry point. If you're an experienced developer, you'll learn how to move faster and think differently about how you write and review code.

It's also a great fit for team leads, managers, and educators who want to understand what AI-assisted development looks like in practice — and what it means for the teams and people they support.

## Audience Skill Level

**Beginning to Intermediate**

Students should have basic familiarity with programming. You do not need to be an expert, that is what AI is for.

Advanced developers are also welcome — the focus on workflow, prompt engineering, and best practices provides value regardless of experience level.

---

## Student Requirements and/or Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with programming concepts
- A GitHub account with Copilot access (free tier or trial) — see VM / Lab / Student Information above
- A modern web browser
- A stable internet connection for the duration of the workshop

---

## Key Takeaways

By the end of this workshop, students will be able to:

- Describe the current landscape of AI coding assistants and understand how GitHub Copilot fits into the broader ecosystem
- Write and run real code — even with little or no prior programming experience — using GitHub Copilot as a guide and collaborator
- Use GitHub Copilot in VS Code to generate, debug, and refactor code
- Write effective prompts and inline comments to guide Copilot toward more accurate and useful suggestions
- Apply AI-assisted development to practical, real-world coding tasks
- Use Copilot Chat and agent features for code explanations, test generation, and complex refactoring
- Evaluate AI-generated code critically — knowing when to accept, modify, or reject suggestions
- Understand security considerations and best practices for AI-assisted development in professional environments
- Identify resources and strategies for continuing to develop AI-assisted coding skills after the workshop
